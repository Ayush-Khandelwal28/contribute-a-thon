- Participants can create issues if there is need like fixing a bug :bug:, writing tests, updating documentation etc, the `@iiitv/project-maintainers` will review the issue and add the labels as stated above then it will be counted as a contribution.
- Participants need to fork the repo before making any contributions.
- The pull request (PR) title should specify the purpose for the PR.

- If you want to work on any issue just tag the `@iiitv/project-maintainers` stating that "I want to work on this issue", the maintainers will assign the respective issue to you.

## Happy Coding 😊
